        <h2 class="section-title">WHAT?</h2>
        <div class="response">
            <p>My co-op at Shoppers has been a blend of <span class="highlight">routine and human connection</span>. Each shift starts with fridge checks - logging temperatures to ensure safety - then shifts to filling prescriptions, a task I've mastered through daily practice. The real adventure lies in customer service: pushing past my comfort zone to assist customers, even those having rough days. Between regulatory tasks and unpredictable interactions, I've learned that growth lives in the balance of structure and spontaneity.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">SO WHAT?</h2>
        <div class="response">
            <p>This placement has transformed me into a <span class="highlight">more resilient and clinically efficient</span> team member. I've developed strong skills in pharmacology inventory management and patient communication, learning to navigate stressed or rushed customers with empathy. Discovering my optimal work style in structured environments while adapting to multitasking demands has been invaluable. The experience has fundamentally deepened my understanding of pharmacy workflows and their impact on community trust.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW?</h2>
        <div class="response">
            <p>Pharmacy work is an <span class="highlight">unexpected blend of science and human connection</span>. Coming in as a Grade 11 student, I learned to embrace initial awkwardness through genuine smiles and treating everyone with respect. If I could time-travel, I'd tell my past self: "Mistakes are tuition for growth - pay attention and learn." The most rewarding part? Seeing how precise medication management directly impacts people's wellbeing and trust in healthcare.</p>
