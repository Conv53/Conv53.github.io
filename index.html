                <p>My co-op at Shoppers has been a blend of routine and human connection. Each shift starts with fridge checks - I log the temperatures (current, max, and min over 12 hours) to ensure safety - then shifts to filling prescriptions, a task I've mastered through daily practice. By streamlining how I organize and prioritize orders, I finish daily quotas ahead of schedule. The real adventure is the "customer service" side: pushing past my comfort zone to greet customers, even those having rough days. Between regulatory tasks and unpredictable interactions, I've learned that growth lives in the balance of structure and spontaneity. What is this journey in one sentence? Equal parts fridge logs, prescription filling, and tiny moments where you realize your effort matters.</p>

            <h2>SO WHAT?</h2>
            <div class="response">
                <p>This placement has transformed me into a more resilient and clinically efficient team member. I've developed strong skills in pharmacology inventory management and patient communication, learning to navigate stressed or rushed customers with empathy. Discovering my optimal work style in structured environments while adapting to multitasking demands has been invaluable. The experience has fundamentally deepened my understanding of pharmacy workflows and their impact on community trust. Most surprisingly, I've found fulfillment in the science-humanity balance - whether ensuring proper medication storage temperatures or seeing how a well-timed antibiotic pickup relieves patient anxiety.</p>

            <h2>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW?</h2>
            <div class="response">
                <p>If you're considering a pharmacy co-op, prepare for an unexpected blend of science and service! Coming in as a Grade 11 student, I learned to embrace initial awkwardness through genuine smiles and treating everyone with respect. The most valuable lesson? "Mistakes are tuition for growth" - each error taught me double-check protocols and communication strategies. What surprised me most was how small actions (proper OTC recommendations, efficient prescription sorting) directly impact patient wellbeing. My advice: Master the "acknowledge-pivot-complete" technique - briefly acknowledge waiting customers, quickly secure your current task, then fully engage with their needs. It's this dance between precision and empathy that makes pharmacy work truly rewarding.</p>
