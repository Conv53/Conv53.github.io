            <h2>WHAT?</h2>
            <div class="response">
                <p>My co-op at Shoppers has been a blend of routine and human connection. Each shift starts with fridge checks, I log the temperatures to ensure safety—then shifts to filling prescriptions, a task I’ve been doing every single day and I mastered it so I can finish a day’s work early. But the real adventure is the “customer service” side: pushing past my comfort zone to greet customers, even those having rough days. It’s not always easy, but the rush of oxytocin and seeing that your work is recognized and valued makes it worth it. Between regulatory tasks and unpredictable interactions, I’ve learned that growth lives in the balance of structure and spontaneity. What is this journey in 1 sentence? Well, equal parts fridge logs, prescription filling, and tiny moments where you realize your effort matters.</p>

        <!-- SO WHAT Section -->

            <h2>SO WHAT?</h2>
            <div class="response">
                <p>This placement has taught me a ton about pharmacology and business inventory management, I have learned many industry standards and how to clinically accelerate efficiency to make sure that everyone is happy. Personally, I have grown more resilient and more extroverted, I am able to manage communication with patients that could be stressed, patients that could be in a rush, or patients that’s just having a bad day. I have also came to learn more about my work style, I work the best under a structured demand/protocol, I will be the best worker that does the work fast and accurate, however, this pivots when I am instructed with 3 or more different tasks. Overall, this coop experience has led me to understand pharmacy workflows much better, from small things like promising customer confidentiality, all the way to optimizing pharmacodynamics in storage and filling, everything that we do makes an impact and it ripples into customer trust, blending science into humanity and community work.</p>

            <h2>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW?</h2>
            <div class="response">
                <p>If you are stepping into ANY pharmacy, you have to brace yourself for science and obviously service. I would have never expected my work at all before stepping intothe  coop, as a grade 11, it feels really odd to be in the workplace, and everyone shoots you a weird look. However, all I have done is to put on a bright smile, treat everyone the way I wish to be treated and really put myself out to enjoy every moment that happens. If I could travel back in time, to tell myself 1 sentence before I started coop, it would always be - you are just a student, mistakes will happen, but it is your responsibility to turn those mistakes into valuable experiences.</p>
